# Deepline.dev 

> Purpose: Turn qualified traffic (ML engineers, technical founders, Heads of ML) into **Early Access** signups while signaling credibility and momentum.
> Tone: direct, technical, no fluff. Visual DNA: dark graphite/black base, soft silver accents, ultramarine/cyan micro-highlights.

## 0) Global navigation (lean)

* **Logo** (top-left)
* **Product** (anchors to How it Works)
* **Playbooks** (Drift Guard, Data Contract Sentry)
* **Security**
* **Docs** (can be “Docs (coming soon)” → email capture)
* **Early Access** (primary button)

> Keep nav fixed, reduce choices. CTA button appears in nav and hero.

---

## 1) Hero (above the fold)

**H1 (value prop):** Secure Overmind early access. Let AI command your ML ops.

**Subhead (clarify outcome):** A vendor‑agnostic **control plane** that unifies monitoring, drift detection, incident response, and automated retraining—**across AWS/Azure/GCP and on‑prem—without lock‑in.**

**Primary CTA:** [Join Early Access]

**Secondary CTA:** [Book a 15‑min discovery] (Calendly)

**Right‑side visual:**

* Short 15–25s silent loop: “Overmind” node hub routing events between tools (GitHub Actions, MLflow/W&B, S3/GCS/Blob, CloudWatch/Prometheus, PagerDuty/Slack). Show auto‑rollback/retrain badges firing.
* Alt: static isometric diagram if video unavailable.

**Micro‑trust strip (beneath CTAs):** “Data stays in your cloud · Least‑privilege · Full audit”

---

## 2) Problem → Outcome (pain framing in 3 bullets)

* **Fragmented monitoring** hides failures and slows response.
* **Ops drag**: small teams burn cycles stitching tools instead of building models.
* **Alert fatigue**: too many dashboards, no closed‑loop remediation.

**Outcome line:** Ship models with confidence—**one plane to observe, decide, and act.**

---

## 3) What Deepline is (one-liner + bullets)

**One‑liner:** Deepline is an **agentic MLOps control plane** with a **unified ML schema** and **cross‑tool event bus** that can **act** (rollback/retrain), not just alert.

**Key capabilities:**

* **Vendor‑agnostic adapters:** AWS / Azure / GCP + on‑prem; MLflow, W&B, ClearML; S3/GCS/Blob; GitHub Actions/Jenkins; CloudWatch/Prometheus; PagerDuty/Slack.
* **Unified data model:** Normalize runs, artifacts, metrics, alerts for single‑pane governance and search.
* **Agentic automation:** Live metric sentries, data/contract checks, daily retrains, noise‑aware routing, “ask‑and‑wire” installs.
* **Enterprise controls:** VPC/on‑prem, least‑privilege, full audit trails.

**CTA (inline):** [See Playbooks]

---

## 4) How it works (3 steps)

1. **Connect your stack** — OAuth/keys to clouds + tools (2–5 minutes).
2. **Select Playbooks** — e.g., **Drift Guard**, **Data Contract Sentry**, **Hotfix Rollback**.
3. **Automate remediation** — Agents execute: block bad deploys, trigger retrains, open PRs, ping on‑call.

**Diagram:** Top‑down blueprint of Overmind hub with spokes to adapters; show event routes (detect → decide → act).

**CTA:** [Get Early Access]

---

## 5) Agent Playbooks (cards)

* **Drift Guard** — Detects data/model drift; auto‑rolls back or schedules retrain; posts diff to Slack; opens PR to bump model version.
* **Data Contract Sentry** — Enforces schema/constraints; quarantines corrupted batches; notifies with minimal false positives.
* **Incident Autopilot** — Correlates alerts across tools; suppresses noise; escalates with run/expt context.

> Each card: 1‑sentence “what it prevents”, 3‑bullet “what it does”, tiny badge: *usage‑based pricing*. Button: [Activate in Early Access].

---

## 6) Why now (context + buyer signal)

* Teams are migrating from **point tools → platform control** without surrendering choice.
* **Dashboard sprawl** + **alert noise** = demand for a **neutral control plane**.
* Forward‑deployed installs show **fast time‑to‑value**; agents being productized.

**CTA:** [Join the Waitlist]

---

## 7) Pricing (pre‑PMF framing)

* **Founder Base (paid, low)** — includes small agent‑run allowance; perfect for startups.
* **Usage Bundles** — per agent run with fair overage; margins protected by infra pass‑through.
* **Team** — seats + pooled credits, RBAC, audit, SLA‑lite.
* **Enterprise Add‑ons** — SSO, VPC/on‑prem surcharge, annual commit credits.

> Copy note: publish tiers *only if ready*. Else show “Pricing during Early Access is discounted; we calibrate with design partners.”

**CTA:** [Request Founder Base]

---

## 8) Social proof / credibility (lean, honest)

* **Founding team:** DS × SWE with multi‑cloud systems and MLOps experience; ship fast via tight feedback loops.
* **Design partners:** “We’re onboarding early adopters in fintech, e‑commerce, platform observability.”
* **Security stance:** “Your data stays in your cloud. We operate with least‑privilege and full auditability.”

> Add logos/testimonials only when real; until then, keep this section text‑based.

---

## 9) Security & compliance (1 short block)

* **Data residency:** in your VPC/tenant; Deepline stores metadata only.
* **Access:** scoped, ephemeral credentials; principle of least privilege.
* **Audit:** end‑to‑end event lineage; tamper‑evident logs.

**CTA:** [Read Security Overview]
