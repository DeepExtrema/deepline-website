Core idea
Single-page, dark, conversion-first site that turns ML engineers and technical founders into Early Access signups. Message: “Secure Overmind early access. Let AI command your ML ops.” Deepline is a vendor-agnostic MLOps control plane that unifies monitoring, drift detection, incident response, and automated retraining across AWS/Azure/GCP/on-prem—without lock-in.

Must-have sections (in order)

Hero (above the fold): H1 + subhead, primary CTA Join Early Access, secondary CTA Book a 15-min discovery (Calendly). Right side: your isometric Overmind diagram. Micro-trust strip: “Data stays in your cloud · Least-privilege · Full audit.”

Problem → Outcome (3 bullets): fragmented monitoring; ops drag; alert fatigue → “One plane to observe, decide, act.”

What Deepline is (bullets): vendor-agnostic adapters; unified ML schema; agentic automation; enterprise controls.

How it works (3 steps): Connect stack → Select Playbooks (Drift Guard, Data Contract Sentry, Incident Autopilot) → Automate remediation.

Playbooks (cards): one sentence “prevents…”, three bullets “does…”, button Activate in Early Access.

Why now: dashboard sprawl → neutral control plane.

Security: data stays in your cloud; scoped creds; audit trails.

Early Access form: fields = email (req), role, company size (opt), primary clouds (checkboxes), top pain (120 chars).

Footer: contact, GitHub, X/LinkedIn, Privacy/Terms.
