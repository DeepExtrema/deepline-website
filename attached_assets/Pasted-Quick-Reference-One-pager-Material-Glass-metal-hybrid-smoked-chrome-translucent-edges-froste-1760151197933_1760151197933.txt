Quick Reference (One-pager)

Material: Glass-metal hybrid (smoked chrome), translucent edges, frosted micro-texture.

Mood: Cold, surgical, quiet power. No warmth.

Key moves: Strong Fresnel rim → soft internal body → tiny bloom on brightest curves → micro-mesh only barely visible.

Background: Absolute black. Object sits slightly below center.

1) Color System

Core Swatches

Highlight white: #E9F1F6 → #CFE0EA

Silver mid: #A6B7C3 → #8C9AA6

Cool shadow: #47525B → #2B3238

Rim bloom: #DDEAF3 @ 10–18% opacity (blurred)

Background: #000000

Contrast target: Peak/average ≈ 6:1. Keep midtones dark enough so highlights read as metal/glass, not plastic.

Gradient Stops (typical edge strip)
#2B3238 (5%) → #8C9AA6 (40%) → #A6B7C3 (60%) → #47525B (95%)

2) Material / Finish

Finish: High gloss with strong Fresnel—edges bright, faces darker.

Translucency: Mild; edges feel thin and glassy (not opaque chrome).

Micro-texture: Very fine satin/mesh visible only in compressed tones (interiors, turns).
Intensity target: 6–12% visibility.

3) Geometry Notes (applies to both ∞ and deepline glyph)

Cross-section: Elliptical ribbon. Slightly flatter on inside curves to catch broad highlight sweeps.

Thickness variance: Subtle—thicker at outer lobes, thinner at crossover/neck.

Twist: Essentially zero. Optional ≤10° at crossover for richer reflections.

Placement: Centered horizontally; lowered 8–12% vertically. Leave headroom.

4) Lighting Blueprint (3-point minimal)

Key Rim (primary)

Type: Area (rect/strip)

Position: Upper-left / front, grazing angle

Size: 1.0–1.5× object width

Color: #DDEAF3 (cool white)

Intensity: High

Counter Rim (secondary)

Position: Upper-right / back

Intensity: 40–60% of key

Fill (subtle)

Position: Below/center

Color: #9FB6C4

Intensity: Low (only to prevent crushed interiors)

Environment: Very dark HDRI with cold highlights only. Clamp to avoid stray bright sources.
Post: Bloom/Glare on top 1–2% brightest pixels; small radius.

5) PBR / Shader (Principled BSDF)

Base Color: #9CAFB9

Metallic: 0.20–0.35 (hybrid glass-metal)

Specular: 0.6–0.8

Roughness: 0.08–0.14 (no mirror)

IOR: 1.45–1.50 (glass Fresnel)

Transmission: 0.25–0.35 (edge translucency)

Subsurface (opt.): 0.05, Radius ≈ (0.2, 0.5, 0.7)

Anisotropy: 0.2 (ribbon sheen)

Clearcoat: 0.25, Clearcoat Roughness: 0.03

Normal/Micro: Mix very fine noise + tiled hex/mesh normal at 0.05–0.10 strength

Fresnel Mix: Use a Fresnel node to drive a glossy rim layer for edge pop.

6) 2D Execution (Photoshop / Figma / Illustrator)
Photoshop

Layer stack (top→bottom)

Rim Bloom (Screen, 10–18%): duplicate highlights, Gaussian Blur 6–12px

Highlights (Screen): painted edge strokes; slight Gaussian Blur 2–4px

Body (Normal): gradient fill; inner glow; satin

Interior Shadow (Multiply): soft form shading

Effects

Body → Gradient Overlay (Linear 0–30°): #2B3238 → #A6B7C3 → #47525B

Body → Inner Glow: #D7E8F1, Screen, Size 8–16px, Choke 0–5%

Body → Satin: Multiply, #2C343A, angle ~30°, distance 10–18px, size 12–20px

Micro-Texture: overlay 200–400px mesh pattern (Soft Light, 6–12%), clipped to shape

Crossover: small elliptical hotspot mask (Screen 30–50%)

Figma

Fill: Linear or Angular gradient (use swatches above)

Inner Shadows (2x): one cool white (low opacity) + one deep blue-gray (strong blur) for Fresnel + cavity

Outer Glow: #E9F1F6, 8–12% opacity, Blur 6–10

Micro-texture: subtle noise overlay (multiply/soft light ≤10%)

Illustrator

Expand stroke → envelope mesh for cross-section shading.

Add Opacity Masks for edge fresnel and crossover glints.

7) Wordmark Treatment (deepline)

Finish: Matte silver, slightly calmer than the symbol

Metallic: ~0.05, Roughness: ~0.20 in PBR terms (or lower gloss in 2D)

Lighting: Gentle top rim highlight only; avoid heavy bloom so the glyph dominates.

Spacing: Keep original kerning; allow slight letter depth via inner shadow to sit in scene.

8) Composition & Export

Scale: Symbol ≈ 70–75% of canvas width; wordmark sized for balance under it.

Vignette: Radial, 0 → 15% at corners; center remains pure black.

Sharpening: Subtle, post-downscale; do not emphasize micro-texture.

Deliverables:

Master: 4096×4096 PNG (16-bit), transparent and on black.

Web: 2048 & 1024 PNG; SVG (flat gradient + masks) for scalable 2D.

Dark-only usage: provide a pure-white fallback mark for non-photoreal contexts.

9) QA Checklist (hard rules)

☐ Midtones too bright? (If yes → plastic. Darken.)

☐ Edges popping via Fresnel? (If no → increase rim layer/clearcoat.)

☐ Roughness varied? (If no → add subtle noise/texture map.)

☐ Any warm hue? (If yes → replace with cool whites/blues.)

☐ Micro-texture restrained? (If visible at arm’s length → reduce to ≤10%.)

☐ Bloom only on top 1–2% brightest pixels? (Keep halo tight.)

10) Applying to the deepline Glyph (shape-specific pointers)

Put strongest rim along the outer left and upper right curves of the glyph.

At the inner bend (where the two tracks converge), add a focused glint and local bloom—this becomes the “nexus.”

For the central circle: treat as a slightly more matte metal bead (Roughness +0.02 vs ribbon) with a tight specular at ~10 o’clock and a soft opposite fill at ~4 o’clock.

The short vertical tick beneath: reduce bloom so it doesn’t steal attention; keep it as a quiet continuation of the ribbon material.
